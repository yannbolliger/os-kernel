/* The behaviour of a console process can be summarised as an infinite 
 * loop over three main steps, namely
 *
 * 1. write a command prompt then read a command,
 * 2. split the command into space-separated tokens using strtok, then
 * 3. execute whatever steps the command dictates.
 *
 * As is, the console only recognises the following commands:
 *
 * a. execute <program name>
 *
 *    This command will use fork to create a new process; the parent
 *    (i.e., the console) will continue as normal, whereas the child
 *    uses exec to replace the process image and thereby execute a
 *    different (named) program.  For example,
 *    
 *    execute P3
 *
 *    would execute the user program named P3.
 *
 * b. terminate <process ID> 
 *
 *    This command uses kill to send a terminate or SIG_TERM signal
 *    to a specific process (identified via the PID provided); this
 *    acts to forcibly terminate the process, vs. say that process
 *    using exit to terminate itself.  For example,
 *  
 *    terminate 3
 *
 *    would terminate the process whose PID is 3.
